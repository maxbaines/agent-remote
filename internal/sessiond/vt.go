// VTBuffer feeds bytes to a concurrency-safe headless cell-grid emulator
// (charmbracelet/x/vt SafeEmulator) and serializes the live grid plus
// scrollback history on Replay.
//
// Compared with RawBuffer, this fixes garbled terminal text on reconnect:
// raw ANSI cursor-positioning sequences replay incorrectly when the terminal
// dimensions differ from when they were recorded, but a grid snapshot is
// always correct regardless of dimensions.
//
// Documented trade-offs:
//   - Two-emulator drift: x/vt here vs xterm.js in the browser. Golden tests
//     CANNOT catch this drift because they measure Replay against the same x/vt
//     implementation.
//   - Heavier memory: a full cell grid (plus emulator scrollback) per pane,
//     versus a flat byte ring.

	//
	// Why this matters: on a full browser page refresh, xterm.js recreates
	// its Terminal instance from scratch with mouse tracking disabled by
	// default. The replay stream is the ONLY way the fresh client learns the
	// PTY-side app (e.g. a modern TUI like OpenCode) already turned mouse
	// tracking on. Without replaying the enabling DECSET sequence, xterm.js
	// falls back to its legacy wheel-to-arrow-key emulation, which most TUIs

	// scroll — see serializeGrid.

//     tracked here — x/vt's own internal restore is correct for the live
//     session; this exists solely to inform replay's synthetic preamble
//     (see serializeGrid), not to implement save/restore semantics itself.
//
//   - enteredAltScreen: p contains a DECSET private-mode set (CSI ?h) for
//     mode 1049, 1047, or 47 — the sequences that enter alternate-screen

// render. This means a reconnecting client's own primary-screen scrollback
// is preserved underneath the alt-screen switch that follows, so exiting the
// alt-screen app (e.g. closing a pager) reveals the shell session rather than
// a blank screen. If mainScreenSnapshot is nil (no alt-screen entry was ever
// observed on this pane's byte stream — e.g. the pane started already in
// alt-screen, or shadow-tracking missed it), this step is skipped and
// behavior falls back to what it was before this pre-emission existed. After
// that, the stream switches into the alt screen, clears, renders, restores
// cursor.  Scrollback is not applicable in alt-screen mode itself.
//
// Primary-screen path:
//  1. Clear + home.
//  2. Scrollback lines (oldest→newest), each rendered with ANSI styling via
//     uv.Line.Render() and terminated with CRLF.  A reconnecting client feeds
//     these to its own terminal emulator; they scroll into the emulator's
//     scrollback as new visible content arrives.
//  3. Visible grid: emu.Render() with bare LF promoted to CRLF so the fresh
//     emulator doesn't stair-step each row.
//  4. If savedCursor is non-nil, re-establish the client's fresh saved-cursor
//     register (DECSC) at that position so a subsequent DECRC restores
//     correctly — this is the shadow-tracker's whole purpose (x/vt's own
//     saved-cursor register is private and cannot otherwise be replayed).
//  5. Cursor restored to its live position via an absolute CUP sequence.
//
// NOTE: uv.Line.Render() emits fully ANSI-styled output.  If a scrollback line
// carries no SGR attributes (typical for plain-text shells) the output is the
// same as the plain-text form.  Styled scrollback (coloured prompts, vim
// status lines that scrolled away) is preserved with full colour fidelity.
//
// mouseMode/mouseSGR: if mouseMode is non-zero (1000/1002/1003) and/or
// mouseSGR is true, the corresponding DECSET sequence(s) are emitted first,
// before either branch below, so a fresh client (e.g. xterm.js recreated by
// a full browser page refresh, which always starts with mouse tracking
// disabled) re-learns that the PTY-side application already turned mouse
// tracking on. Without this, wheel-scroll input over the pane falls back to
// xterm.js's legacy arrow-key emulation, which most TUIs interpret as
// scrollback/history navigation instead of an actual mouse-wheel scroll.
