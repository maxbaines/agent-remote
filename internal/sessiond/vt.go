//
// Why this IS the scroll-off hook: charmbracelet/x/vt pushes a line onto the
// main screen's Scrollback exactly when that line scrolls off the top of the
// live grid — LF at the bottom margin goes Emulator.index -> Screen.ScrollUp ->
// Screen.DeleteLine -> Scrollback.PushN, and ED 2 goes through
// Screen.ClearWithScrollback. It never pushes a line that is still on-screen.
// That is precisely the design's "append only on scroll-off" rule, obtained by
// observing the engine rather than by re-deriving it. Alt-screen output does
// NOT land here: Emulator.Scrollback() is the MAIN screen's scrollback, so a
// full-screen TUI's redraws never pollute history.
//
// Why the explicit trim: Scrollback evicts its own oldest line once it is full
// and exposes no eviction count, so a self-evicting scrollback makes "how many
// lines were pushed since I last looked?" unanswerable. NewVTBuffer therefore
// configures a large maxLines (vtEmuScrollbackHeadroom) so the emulator does
// not self-evict, and this function performs the eviction itself, by an exact
// amount: SetMaxLines(keep) trims to the newest keep lines (and never grows),
// then SetMaxLines(headroom) restores the headroom without touching content.
// Net effect for every other reader (Replay/serializeGrid/
// captureMainScreenSnapshot): whenever b.mu is released, the emulator
// scrollback holds at most vtEmuScrollbackKeep == the pre-existing 2000 lines,
// so replay output is unchanged.
//
// Known, accepted edge cases:
//   - ED 3 (ESC[3J) clears the emulator's scrollback. sbSeen resynchronises
//     downward, and lines already mirrored stay in history: the daemon's own
//     record of what scrolled past is not erased by an application repainting.
//   - A single 32 KiB chunk that pushes more lines than the headroom would let
//     the emulator drop lines we never saw. Those lines are, by definition,
//     older than the newest 10,000 the ring keeps anyway; historySeq stays

// a blank screen. If mainScreenSnapshot is nil (no alt-screen entry was ever

// alt-screen, or shadow-tracking missed it), this step is skipped and
// behavior falls back to what it was before this pre-emission existed. After
// that, the stream switches into the alt screen, clears, renders, restores
// cursor.  Scrollback is not applicable in alt-screen mode itself.
//
// Primary-screen path:
//  1. Clear + home.
//  2. Scrollback lines (oldest→newest), each rendered with ANSI styling via
//     uv.Line.Render() and terminated with CRLF.  A reconnecting client feeds
//     these to its own terminal emulator; they scroll into the emulator's
//     scrollback as new visible content arrives.
//  3. Visible grid: emu.Render() with bare LF promoted to CRLF so the fresh
//     emulator doesn't stair-step each row.
//  4. If savedCursor is non-nil, re-establish the client's fresh saved-cursor
//     register (DECSC) at that position so a subsequent DECRC restores
//     correctly — this is the shadow-tracker's whole purpose (x/vt's own
//     saved-cursor register is private and cannot otherwise be replayed).
//  5. Cursor restored to its live position via an absolute CUP sequence.
//
// NOTE: uv.Line.Render() emits fully ANSI-styled output.  If a scrollback line
