    // no filtering) but nothing acts on them without this addon.
    //
    // SECURITY: the addon's default BrowserClipboardProvider implements BOTH
    // read (OSC 52 query, Pt = "<selection>;?") and write. We deliberately
    // supply our own write-only provider instead — iTerm2, Kitty, and
    // Alacritty all disable OSC 52 read by default, since it lets any
    // program running in the terminal (including a remote SSH session)
    // silently exfiltrate the user's OS clipboard the instant read
    // permission is granted, with no user gesture required. readText() below
    // always resolves to '', so the addon's query path never reaches
    // navigator.clipboard.readText() at all.

    // runs at all.
    //
    // xterm.js's OscParser (src/common/parser/OscParser.ts) keeps handlers

    // it runs first: it swallows the query ("<selection>;?") by returning
